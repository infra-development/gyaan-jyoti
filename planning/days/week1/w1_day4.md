# ðŸ“… Week 1 â€“ Day 4 (Thursday, Office Day)
**Focus**: Linked List â†’ Reverse (iterative/recursive), Detect Cycle, Merge Two Lists  
**Time**: 07:30 â€“ 10:00 (2.5h)

---

## **07:30â€“07:40 (10 min) â†’ Warm-up**
- Problem: [141. Linked List Cycle](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/)
- **Goal**: Get comfortable with linked list traversal.
- **Theory if stuck**: Floydâ€™s Tortoise and Hare algorithm (fast & slow pointer).

---

## **07:40â€“08:10 (30 min) â†’ Reverse Linked List**
1. [206. Reverse Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/)
    - **Goal**: Learn iterative reversal using 3 pointers (`prev`, `curr`, `next`).
    - **Theory if stuck**: Draw pointer movement step by step.

2. [92. Reverse Linked List II](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list-ii/)
    - **Goal**: Reverse a sublist (positions m to n).
    - **Theory if stuck**: Use dummy node + isolate sublist + reverse + reconnect.

---

## **08:10â€“08:50 (40 min) â†’ Cycle Detection**
1. [142. Linked List Cycle II](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle-ii/)
    - **Goal**: Detect cycle and return cycle start node.
    - **Theory if stuck**: Once slow/fast meet, reset one pointer to head, move both at same speed.

2. [876. Middle of the Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/middle-of-the-linked-list/)
    - **Goal**: Reinforce fast & slow pointer pattern.
    - **Theory if stuck**: Fast moves 2 steps, slow moves 1.

---

## **08:50â€“09:30 (40 min) â†’ Merge Lists**
1. [21. Merge Two Sorted Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/)
    - **Goal**: Classic merging with pointers.
    - **Theory if stuck**: Use dummy head, attach smaller node, move pointer.

2. [23. Merge k Sorted Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-k-sorted-lists/)
    - **Goal**: Learn priority queue/heap-based merging.
    - **Theory if stuck**: Min-heap approach or divide-and-conquer merging.

---

## **09:30â€“09:55 (25 min) â†’ Practice & Variation**
- [234. Palindrome Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-linked-list/)
    - **Goal**: Combine reverse + middle finding in one problem.
    - **Theory if stuck**: Find mid, reverse second half, compare halves.

---

## **09:55â€“10:00 (5 min) â†’ Wrap-up**
- Notes to record:
    - Reverse (iterative vs recursive).
    - Cycle detection (fast/slow pointer).
    - Merge strategies (2 lists vs k lists).
    - Common interview follow-ups (space complexity, recursion depth).

---

# âœ… Outcome of Day 4
- Solved **6â€“7 linked list problems** covering reverse, cycle, merging.
- Mastered **fast/slow pointers** and **merge techniques**.
- Notes ready for Friday review.
