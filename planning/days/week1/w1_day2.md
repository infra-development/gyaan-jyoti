# ðŸ“… Week 1 â€“ Day 2 (Tuesday)
**Focus**: Strings â†’ Anagrams, Longest Substring, Palindrome Problems  
**Time**: 07:30 â€“ 10:00 (2.5h)

---

## **07:30â€“07:40 (10 min) â†’ Warm-up**
- Problem: [14. Longest Common Prefix](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-prefix/)
- **Goal**: Simple string scanning problem.
- **Theory if stuck**: Compare characters across strings column by column.

---

## **07:40â€“08:10 (30 min) â†’ Anagrams**
1. [242. Valid Anagram](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram/)
    - **Goal**: Frequency counting with arrays/hashmaps.
    - **Theory if stuck**: ASCII/Unicode char counts.

2. [49. Group Anagrams](https://leetcode.com/problems/group-anagrams/)
    - **Goal**: Learn to use sorted string/hashmap as grouping key.
    - **Theory if stuck**: Sorting string vs using frequency count as key.

---

## **08:10â€“08:50 (40 min) â†’ Longest Substring Problems**
1. [424. Longest Repeating Character Replacement](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-repeating-character-replacement/)
    - **Goal**: Variable window where at most `k` replacements allowed.
    - **Theory if stuck**: Window length â€“ most freq char count â‰¤ k.

2. [763. Partition Labels](https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-labels/)
    - **Goal**: Learn greedy string partitioning.
    - **Theory if stuck**: Track last index of each char; cut partition when reaching max last index.

---

## **08:50â€“09:30 (40 min) â†’ Palindrome Problems**
1. [5. Longest Palindromic Substring](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-substring/)
    - **Goal**: Apply **expand-around-center** technique.
    - **Theory if stuck**: Odd/even centers for palindrome growth.

2. [131. Palindrome Partitioning](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-partitioning/)
    - **Goal**: Backtracking with palindrome checks.
    - **Theory if stuck**: Explore all partitions, prune when substring isnâ€™t palindrome.

---

## **09:30â€“09:55 (25 min) â†’ Mixed Practice**
- [125. Valid Palindrome](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome/)
    - **Goal**: Learn string normalization + two-pointer check.
    - **Theory if stuck**: Clean string (alphanumeric, lowercase) before comparing.

---

## **09:55â€“10:00 (5 min) â†’ Wrap-up**
- Notes to record:
    - Anagrams â†’ hashmap/sort key trick.
    - Longest substring â†’ sliding window with condition.
    - Palindromes â†’ expand-around-center + backtracking.
- Flag confusing problems â†’ revisit on Friday.

---

# âœ… Outcome of Day 2
- 6â€“7 new problems solved (no overlap with Day 1).
- Learned **anagram tricks, substring sliding window, palindrome center/backtracking**.
- Notes ready for quick review.
